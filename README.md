# MSc Connected Industry 4.0 - Intelligent Processing Data Tools

This repository contains the microassignments and final project for the Intelligent Processing Data Tools subject of the UC3M MSc in Connected Industry 4.0 program.

## Overview

The Intelligent Processing Data Tools subject covers different techniques and tools for processing and analyzing data in the context of Industry 4.0. The microassignments and final project included in this repository are designed to help students apply the concepts and techniques learned during the course.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `Microassignments`: This directory contains the microassignments for the subject. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific microassignment and contains the necessary files and instructions to complete it. Packages used include:
  - `Pandas`<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>
  - `Scikit-learn`<https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>
  - `Matplotlib`<https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>

## Contributing

This repository is intended to show the educational milestones that we had to achieve in the masterÂ´s degree. It is not intended to serve as a software project or an algorithm development, and thus it is not maintained further than the code corresponding to the final submission of either the assignments and the final project.

## Additional clarifications

The CSV files are NOT of my creation nor part of the intellectual porperty of the code presented in the repository, they are just means for the completion of the assignments and have been facilitated by the UC3M.
